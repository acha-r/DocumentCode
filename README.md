A guideline for adding custom attributes to types and their members

The program has three classes implementing a GetDocs method that does the following:
- Prints custom attributes to Console ONLY
- Writes custom attributes into a .txt file, reads and still prints content to the console
- Writes custom attributes into a .json file, reads and ... wait for it ... prints output to the console.
